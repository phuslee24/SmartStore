            by their followers. While they have their own website, most of them continue to be active on Instagram and YouTube.</p>

                to break the assumption that some trends are suited only to a particular age group. Ashleigh’s philosophy centers around the notion that “age is only a number.”</p><br>
            <p>Ashleigh’s blog is full of advice for the regular woman to make better fashion choices, whether it’s “Dressing Better With the Clothes You Have” or starting a capsule wardrobe. Along with her blog posts, she has also published e-books and
                has even held online webinars to help people improve their fashion sense.</p><br>

            <img src="https://influencermarketinghub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/eggcanvas.jpg.webp" alt="">
            <br>
            <p>The whimsically named Egg Canvas is the brainchild of Erica Choi, a design director and photographer based in New York.</p><br>
            <p>Why the name “Egg Canvas”? Erica was inspired by her Korean childhood nickname, which means egg, while “canvas” is the medium with which art is created. “Egg Canvas,” therefore, is her life—creating beautiful things each day on a blank canvas.</p><br>
            <p>A licensed esthetician and graphic design graduate, Erica has a discerning eye for visuals. The posts on Egg Canvas have beautiful photos that are accompanied by short texts.</p><br>
            <p>The blog includes a section showcasing the latest New York Fashion Week as well as a guide around NYC.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Let’s face it—the body type of models is far from reality. Slim people do exist in real life, but there are women with bigger sizes who can look just as good. People come in all shapes and sizes, but many of us have been conditioned to believe
                that only one body type is ideal for fashion.</p><br>
            <p>This is the mindset that Girl With Curves hopes to shatter. Tanesha Awasthi created Girl With Curves in 2011 to represent everyday people who aren’t a size 0 or 2. The blog describes itself as an “award-winning blog made possible by people
                who believe women deserve to look and feel beautiful, regardless of weight, shape or size.”</p><br>
            <p>Since starting the blog, Tanesha has become a favorite plus-sized fashion blogger in the industry. She hopes to help women—particularly bigger sized women—build their confidence and self-esteem through fashion.</p><br>
            <p>The blog includes trends, style tips, beauty advice, plus parenting and wellness. Their hashtag #StyleHasNoSize emphasizes their belief that fashion and style are for everyone, regardless of their body type.</p><br>
            <p>In 2021, they launched the Girl With Curves at QVC collection, featuring pieces with true size inclusivity.</p>
